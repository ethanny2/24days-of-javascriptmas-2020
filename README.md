## Day 1

Question: n children have got m pieces of candy. They each want to eat as much candy as they can, but each child must eat exactly the same amount of candy as the other children. Determine how many pieces of candy will be eaten by all the children together.
**\*Note: Individual pieces of candy cannot be split**

#### Answer:

```
const candies = (children, candy) => {
    const amountEatenEach = Math.floor(candy / children);
    return amountEatenEach * children;
}
```

#### Logic:
Divide number of candies by number of children and round down. (Math.floor). This is how many pieces each child will get individually, but the question asks the total
pieces eaten so you multiply by the # of children.
